## About The Project

This is a take home assignment assigned to me by a company. This web app is still very basic but expect to see more features!

## Some Features

- Automatically track commit if there is the repo has no release
- Can filter tracked repo by name

## Potential Upcoming Features

- More options to filter repositories list (by latest updates/alphabetical sorting/date added and so on)
- User Login/Account creation
- Better, more intuitive UI similar to Spotify's playlist UI
- A clear X button to clear search input
- improve release note visual (it's currently displaying GitHub's README markup in plain text, which is a bit hard to read)

### `npm start`
